# Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

# A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

# Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

# Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.
# Example 1:

# Input: s = "the sky is blue"
# Output: "blue is sky the"

class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
       s=s.split()
       i=0
       j=len(s)-1
       s=list(s)
       while i<=j:
            s[i],s[j]=s[j],s[i]
            i+=1
            j-=1
       return " ".join(s)
